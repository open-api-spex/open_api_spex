The original cast & validation API has been deprecated and replaced with an API that was introduced in 3.2.0.
Using the old API will now result in compiler and runtime warnings.

Old API:

```elixir
defmodule PhoenixAppWeb.UserController do
  use PhoenixAppWeb, :controller
  plug OpenApiSpex.Plug.Cast
  plug OpenApiSpex.Plug.Validate
end
```

Will result in:

```
warning: OpenApiSpex.Plug.Cast.call/2 is deprecated. Use OpenApiSpex.Plug.CastAndValidate instead
  test/support/user_controller.ex:1

warning: OpenApiSpex.Plug.Validate.call/2 is deprecated. Use OpenApiSpex.Plug.CastAndValidate.call/2 instead
  test/support/user_controller.ex:1
```

New API

```elixir
defmodule PhoenixAppWeb.UserController do
  use PhoenixAppWeb, :controller
  plug OpenApiSpex.Plug.CastAndValidate, json_render_error_v2: true
end
```

Note that this changes the default error response. Before, it was a single, plain-text error message.
Now, it's a list of error maps, containing more error information.

Old API:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.MyControllerTest do
  use MyApp.ConnCase
  # Old module
  import OpenApiSpex.Test.Assertions

  ## The test themselves don't need to change

  test "UserController produces a UsersResponse", %{conn: conn} do
    api_spec = MyApp.ApiSpec.spec()
    json =
      conn
      |> get(user_path(conn, :index))
      |> json_response(200)

    assert_schema(json, "UsersResponse", api_spec)
  end

  test "something" do
    api_spec = MyApp.ApiSpec.spec()
    schema = MyApp.Schemas.UsersResponse.schema()
    assert_schema(schema.example, "UsersResponse", api_spec)
  end
end
```

Will produce:

```
warning: OpenApiSpex.Test.Assertions.assert_schema/3 is deprecated. Use OpenApiSpex.TestAssertions.assert_schema/3 instead
  test/my_controller_test.exs:21
```

New API:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.MyControllerTest do
  use MyApp.ConnCase
  # New module
  import OpenApiSpex.TestAssertions

  # The test themselves don't need to change,
  # but the new assertion is more discerning,
  # so it may find problems that the old API didn't.
end
```

## v3.4.0 - 2019-06-14

Thanks to the contributions of the community 仇벒잺游눛游눝游눞游비

- [fmcgeough](https://github.com/fmcgeough)

* Feature: the `OpenApiSpex` and `OpenApiSpex.Info` structs now support [extensions](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/) (#108) (#114)

  The `extensions` key may contain any additional data that should be included in the info, eg the `x-logo` and `x-tagGroups` extensions:

  ```elixir
   spec = %OpenApi{
     info: %Info{
       title: "Test",
       version: "1.0.0",
       extensions: %{
         "x-logo" => %{
           "url" => "https://example.com/logo.png",
           "backgroundColor" => "#FFFFFF",
           "altText" => "Example logo"
         }
       }
     },
     extensions: %{
       "x-tagGroups" => [
         %{
           "name" => "Methods",
           "tags" => [
             "Search",
             "Fetch",
             "Delete"
           ]
         }
       ]
     },
     paths: %{ ... }
   }
  ```

- Deprecation: `OpenApiSpex.Server.from_endpoint/2` has been deprecated in favor of `OpenApiSpex.Server.from_endpoint/1`.
  Simply remove the `otp_app:` option from the call to use the new function. (#116)

  ```elixir
  # server = Server.from_endpoint(Endpoint, otp_app: :my_phoenix_app)
  server = Server.from_endpoint(MyPhoenixAppWeb.Endpoint)
  ```

- Fix: The internal representation of a Phoenix Route struct changed in Phoenix 1.4.7 breaking the `OpenApiSpex.Paths.from_router/1` function. OpenApiSpex 3.4.0 will support both representations until the Phoenix API becomes stable. (#118)

## v3.3.0 - 2019-05-05

* Feature: Enums expressed as atoms or atom-keyed maps can be cast from strings (or string-keyed maps). (#60) (#101)

  Example:

  ```elixir
  parameters: [
    Operation.parameter(:sort, :query, :string, "sort direction", enum: [:asc, :desc])
  ],
  ```

- Fix: Schema module references are resolved in in-line parameter/response schemas. (#77) (#105)

  Example: The response schema is given in-line as an array, but items are resolved from the `User` module.

  ```elixir
  responses: %{
    200 => Operation.response(
      "User array",
      "application/json",
      %Schema{
        type: :array,
        items: MyApp.Schemas.User
      }
    )
  }
  ```

- Fix: Ensure integer query parameters are validated correctly after conversion from string. (#106)
- Fix: Ensure integers are validated correctly against schema `minimum`, `maximum`, `exlcusiveMinimum` and `exclusiveMaximum` attributes. (#97)
- Fix: Ensure strings are cast to `Date` or `DateTime` types when the schema format is `:date` or `:date-time`. (#90) (#94)
- Docs: The contract for module supplied to the `PutApiSpec` plug is now documented by the `OpenApi` behaviour. (#73) (#103)
- Docs: Poison replaced with Jason in example and tests (#104)

Thanks to [fenollp](https://github.com/fenollp) and [tapickell](https://github.com/tapickell) for contributions!

## v3.0.0 - 2018-10-25

Major version bump as the behaviour of `OpenApiSpex.Plug.Cast` has changed (#39).
To enable requests that contain a body as well as path or query params, the result of casting the
request body is now placed in the `Conn.body_params` field, instead of the combined `Conn.params` field.

This requires changing code such as Phoenix controller actions to from

```elixir
def create(conn, %UserRequest{user: %User{name: name, email: email}}) do
```

to

```elixir
  def create(conn = %{body_params: %UserRequest{user: %User{name: name, email: email}}}, params) do
```

- Feature: A custom plug may be provided to render errors (#46)
- Fix compiler warnings and improve CI process (#53)
- Fix: Support casting GET requests without Content-Type header (#50, #49)
- Open API Spex has been moved to the new `open-api-spex` Github organisation

## v2.3.1 - 2018-09-09

- Docs: Update example application to include swagger generate mix task (#41)
- Fix: Ignore charset in content-type header when looking up schema by content type. (#45)

Thanks to [dmt](https://github.com/dmt) and [fenollp](https://github.com/fenollp) for contributions!

## v2.3.0 - 2018-08-05

- Feature: Validate string enum types. (#33)
- Feature: Detect and report missing API spec in `OpenApiSpex.Plug.Cast` (#37)
- Fix: Correct atom for parameter `style` field typespec (#36)

Thanks to [slavo2](https://github.com/slavo2) and [anagromataf](https://github.com/anagromataf) for
contributions!

## v2.2.0 - 2018-07-07

- Feature: Support composite schemas in `OpenApiSpex.schema`

  structs defined with `OpenApiSpex.schema` will include all properties defined in schemas
  listed in `allOf`. See the `OpenApiSpex.Schema` docs for some examples.

- Feature: Support composite and polymorphic schemas with `OpenApiSpex.cast/3`.
  - `discriminator` is used to cast polymorphic shemas to a more specific schema.
  - `allOf` will cast all properties in each included schema
  - `oneOf` / `anyOf` will attempt to use each schema until a successful cast is made

## v2.1.1 - 2018-06-12

- Fix: (#24, #25) Operations that define `parameters` and a `requestBody` schema can be validated.

## v2.1.0 - 2018-06-08

- Feature: (#16) Error response from `OpenApiSpex.cast` when value contains unknown properties and schema declares `additionalProperties: false`.
- Feature: (#20) Update swagger-ui to version 3.17.0.
- Fix: (#17, #21, #22) Update typespecs for struct types.

## v2.0.0 - 2018-06-06

Major version update following from API change in `OpenApiSpex.cast` and `OpenApiSpex.validate`.
When casting/validating all parameters against an `OpenApiSpex.Operation`, the complete `Plug.Conn` struct must now be passed, where the combined params map was previously accepted.
This allows `OpenApiSpex.cast` / `OpenApiSpex.validate` to check that the parameters are being supplied in the expected location (query, path, body, header, cookie).
In version 2.0.0, only unexpected query parameters will cause a 422 response from `OpenApiSpex.Plug.Cast`, this may be extended in future versions to detect more invalid requests.

Thanks [cstaud](https://github.com/cstaud), [rutho](https://github.com/ThomasRueckert), [anagromataf](https://github.com/anagromataf) for contributions!

- Change: (#9) swagger-ui updated to 3.13.4
- Change (#9) Unexpected query parameters will produce an error response from `OpenApiSpex.Plug.Cast`
- Change: (#9) `OpenApiSpex.cast/4` now requires a complete `Plug.Conn` struct when casting all parameters of an `OpenApiSpex.Operation`
- Change: (#14) `OpenApiSpex.validate/4` now requires a complete `Plug.Conn` struct when validating all parameters of an `OpenApiSpex.Operation`
- Fix: (#11) Support resolving list of schema modules in `oneOf`, `anyOf`, etc.
- Fix: `OpenApiSpex.schema` macro allows defining schemas without any properties
- Fix: type declarations better reflect when `nil` is allowed
